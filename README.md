# Analyse Sales Data to Decide Marketing Strategy For XYZ Company

## Important to note:
`I do not have SQLite & PySpark setup in my system. Though I wrote the code to read data from SQLite, I could not verify those lines of code. So, I have commented on those parts & finished the assignment while reading data from the DBFS location using PySpark in Databricks.`
#
I solved the assignment in 3 different ways: Pandas, SQL & PySpark
